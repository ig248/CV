 ## Experience
`Jul 2018 - present$` **Lead Data Scientist** - *USIO Energy*

Developing unique personalised energy demand forecasting technology ground-up.
Using deep learning and smart meter data to bring the energy industry into the 21st century.

* hands-on lead in a team of 6 Data Scientists, Software Engineers and Machine Learning Engineers
* implemented core machine learning framework for reproducible model development and deployment
* conceived, researched and implemented novel deep learning approaches to time series forecasting
* implemented preprocessing, feature extraction and data aggregation pipelines
* hired key team members
* introduced processes and best practices

`Jan 2018 - Jul 2018` **Senior Data Scientist** - *Jawbone Health *

I developed machine learning solutions for novel medical diagnostics from wearable sensors.

* developed and implementad a range of signal processing, Bayesian, and machine learning techniques applied to multi-channel clinical time series
* developed a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm for early diagnostics of atrial fibrillation
* authored a conference paper and and presented results at KDD2018

`Feb 2016 - Jan 2018` **Algorithm Development/Control Systems Engineer** - *Cambridge Mechatronics Limited*

I developed novel optical image stabilization and autofocus systems from R&D through to mass production. I worked with a multi-disciplinary team of firmware, software, and mechanical engineers, and collaborated with major players in the mobile electronics sector.

* designed and implemented advanced multi-dimensional closed-loop control algorithms for highly nonlinear thermally actuated systems, using `python`/`scipy` and `MATLAB` for prototyping and `C` for embedded implementation

* developed a range of `python`, `MATLAB` and `C` tools for real-time sensor data acquisition and processing - from supporting low-level serial communications through to applying machine learning techniques to optimize real-world product performance

* applied data science techniques to manufacturing data, identifying hardware and firmware problems in production, and optimizing information gain from quality control tests

* designed and implemented image acquisition, processing and feature extraction pipelines that allowed critical optimizations across a range of customer projects, using Android shell, `python` and `MATLAB`

* developed physical models and simulations combining thermal, mechanical and electrical processes, using efficient numerical implementations in `python`/`scipy`

* improved internal software development, testing and release processes, automating software, firmware and hardware tests from prototype PCB to handset level

`Apr 2014 - Oct 2016` **Professional Yacht Race Skipper** - *Clipper Ventures, various*

After completing my PhD, I have pursued a number of sailing projects: restoring an ocean-going yacht, teaching sailing, and working as a professional race skipped for a round-the-world yacht race.

  * used a range of weather analysis, data collection and performance optimisation tools to ensure racing success, developed custom scripts for working with `grib` weather files
  * fixing critical electronic and mechanical systems in extreme conditions was part of my daily routine
  * oversaw budgeting, maintenance and day-to-day operations of a yacht with a crew of 20+ and a value in the 7-figures
  * trained and lead an international team of 60+ sailors
  * provided an engaging story for the stakeholders, customers and sponsors through regular blogs and multimedia

`Sep 2010 - Apr 2014` **PhD in ultra-cold atom physics** - *University of Cambridge*

I completed my PhD thesis on ‚ÄúDegenerate Bose Gases in a Uniform Potential‚Äù. The appeal of my chosen research field lies in combining experimental work with advanced theoretical understanding of condensed matter physics.

  * developed custom image analysis tools and algorithms
  * designed, manufactured and assembled custom vacuum, electronic, laser, and imaging systems
  * implemented a real-time control and DAQ system with custom software and electronics
  * used a combination of analytical, numerical, and computer algebra methods to develop a theoretical framework for describing a novel class of thermo-dynamic systems
  * authored multiple articles in top peer-reviewed journals

`Jun 2007 - Aug 2010` **Summer Research Student** - *Max-Planck Institute for Quantum Optics*

During my undergraduate years, I joined a Nobel-prize-winning research group in Munich as a summer student to work on developing new laser systems for precision metrology.

  * I wrote high-performance code in C and Mathematica to simulate non-linear atomic and optical phenomena, aiding in the development of new laser systems
  * My work lead to co-authoring two papers and presenting the results at seminars

`Sep 2006 - Jun 2010` **MSci in experimental and theoretical physics** - *University of Cambridge*

I took a combination of theory and math-intensive courses from the Mathematics and the Natural Sciences Tripos, achieving top grades throughout.

My Master‚Äôs thesis on ‚ÄúMicrowave Manipulation of Ultracold Atoms‚Äù combined development of experimental microwave electronics, software control systems and a theoretical study of thermodynamics in reduced dimensionalities.

`Sep 1994 - Jul 2006` **High school diploma (Abitur)** - *Germany*

I completed the German Abitur top of the year with a grade of 1.0 (equivalent to an A* average), majoring in maths and physics. During my school years, I have won numerous awards for mathematics and science competitions.
