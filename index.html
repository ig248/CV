## Experience
`Feb 2016 - present$` **Test and Control Engineer** - *Cambridge Mechatronics Limited*

In my current role, I combine my mathematical skills, coding and advanced understanding of physics to develop novel products from concept to mass production for the mobile devices market.

  * designing key control algorithms for novel products, working with a team of firmware engineers to implement, test and deploy these
  
  * developing image analysis, data processing and visualisation tools for internal and customer use
  
  * working with a team of electronics and mechanical engineers to solve diverse R&D and production problems 

  * developing and deploying test automation and continuous integration tools
  
  
`Apr 2014 - Oct 2016` **Professional Yacht Race Skipper** - *Clipper Ventures, various*

After completing my PhD, I have pursued a number of sailing projects: restoring an ocean-going yacht, teaching sailing, and working as a professional race skipped for a round-the-world yacht race.
  
  * fixing critical electronic and mechanical systems in extreme conditions was part of my daily routine
  * oversaw budgeting, maintenance and day-to-day operations of a yacht with a crew of 20+ and a value in the 7-figures
  * trained and lead an international team of 60+ sailors
  * provided an engaging story for the stakeholders, customers and sponsors through regular blogs and multimedia   
  * used a range of weather analysis, data collection and performance optimisation tools to ensure racing success
   
`Sep 2010 - Apr 2014` **PhD in ultra-cold atom physics** - *University of Cambridge*

I completed my PhD thesis on ‚ÄúDegenerate Bose Gases in a Uniform Potential‚Äù. The appeal of my chosen research field lies in combining experimental work with advanced theoretical understanding of condensed matter physics.

  * designed, manufactured and assembled custom vacuum, electronic, laser, and imaging systems
  * implemented a real-time control and DAQ system with custom software and electronics
  * developed custom image analysis tools and algorithms
  * used a combination of analytical, numerical, and computer algebra methods to develop a theoretical framework for describing a novel class of thermo-dynamic systems
  * authored multiple articles in top peer-reviewed journals

`Jun 2007 - Aug 2010` **Summer Research Student** - *Max-Planck Institute for Quantum Optics*

During my undergraduate years, I joined a Nobel-prize-winning research group in Munich as a summer student to work on developing new laser systems for precision metrology.

  * I wrote high-performance code in C and Mathematica to simulate non-linear atomic and optical phenomena, aiding in the development of new laser systems
  * My work lead to co-authoring two papers and presenting the results at seminars

`Sep 2006 - Jun 2010` **MSci in experimental and theoretical physics** - *University of Cambridge*

I took a combination of theory and math-intensive courses from the Mathematics and the Natural Sciences Tripos, achieving top grades throughout. 

My Master‚Äôs thesis on ‚ÄúMicrowave Manipulation of Ultracold Atoms‚Äù combined development of experimental microwave electronics, software control systems and a theoretical study of thermodynamics in reduced dimensionalities.

`Sep 1994 - Jul 2006` **High school diploma (Abitur)** - *Germany*

I completed the German Abitur top of the year with a grade of 1.0 (equivalent to an A* average), majoring in maths and physics. During my school years, I have won numerous awards for mathematics and science competitions.

## üèÜ Awards and Achievements

  * Gates Cambridge Scholar
  * Sir Nevill Mott Prize for best Master‚Äôs thesis
  * Churchill College Scholar
  * top of the year in Cambridge for three years running
  * Scholar by the Cambridge European Trust
  * Scholar of the German Studienstiftung
  * Winner of the European Union Contest for Young Scientists
  * captain and winner of the German team in the International Young Physicists' Tournament
  * three-time gold medallist in the International Physics Olympiad
  * part of the German selection for the International Mathematics Olympiad
