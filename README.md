My personal CV on GitHub Pages: https://ig248.github.io/CV/

### Boring details

The CV is written in Markdown and rendered using [Strapdown.js](http://strapdownjs.com/).

Special characters are included by using UTF-16 encoding.

Strapdown uses [prettify.js](https://github.com/google/code-prettify) to render code blocks. Since I am abusing Markdown inline code blocks for stylistic purposes, a custom css is needed to override or adjust syntax highlighting.
